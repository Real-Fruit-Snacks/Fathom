LTRACE(1)                                                     General Commands Manual                                                    LTRACE(1)

NAME
       ltrace - A library call tracer

SYNOPSIS
       ltrace [-CdfhiLrStttV] [-a column] [-A maxelts] [-D level] [-e expr] [-l library_pattern] [-n nr] [-o filename] [-p pid] ... [-s strsize]
       [-u username] [-w count] [-x filter] [--align=column] [--debug=level] [--demangle] [--help] [--indent=nr] [--library=library_pattern]
       [--output=filename] [--version] [--where=NR] [command [arg ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command until it exits. It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are
       called by the executed process and the signals which are received by that process. It can also intercept and print the system calls
       executed by the program.

       Its use is very similar to strace(1).

OPTIONS
       -a, --align column
              Align return values in a specific column (default column is 5/8 of screen width).

       -A maxelts
              Maximum  number  of  array  elements  to print before suppressing the rest with an ellipsis ("...").  This also limits number of
              recursive structure expansions.

       -b, --no-signals
              Disable printing of signals received by the traced process.

       -c     Count time and calls for each library call and report a summary on program exit.

       -C, --demangle
              Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names. Besides removing any initial underscore  prefix  used  by  the
              system, this makes C++ function names readable.

       -D, --debug level
              Show debugging output of ltrace itself. level must be a sum of some of the following numbers:

              01     DEBUG_GENERAL.  Shows helpful progress information
              010    DEBUG_EVENT.  Shows every event received by a traced program
              020    DEBUG_PROCESS.  Shows every action ltrace carries upon a traced process
              040    DEBUG_FUNCTION.  Shows every entry to internal functions

       -e filter
              A qualifying expression which modifies which library calls to trace. The format of the filter expression is described in the
              section FILTER EXPRESSIONS. If more than one -e option appears on the command line, the library calls  that  match  any  of  them
              are traced. If no -e is given, @MAIN is assumed as a default.

       -f     Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of the fork(2) or clone(2) system calls.
              The new process is attached immediately.

       -F pathlist
              Contains a colon-separated list of paths. If a path refers to a directory, that directory is considered when  searching for
              relevant  files.  If it refers to a plain file, that file is imported. See ltrace.conf(5) for details on the syntax of ltrace
              configuration files.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the options to ltrace and exit.

       -i     Print the instruction pointer at the time of the library call.

       -l, --library library_pattern
              Display only calls to functions implemented by libraries that  match  library_pattern.  Multiple  library  patterns  can  be
              specified  with several instances of this option. Syntax of library_pattern is described in section FILTER EXPRESSIONS.

              Note that while this option selects calls that  might  be  directed  to  the  selected  libraries,  there's  no  actual guarantee
              that the call won't be directed elsewhere due to e.g. LD_PRELOAD or simply dependency ordering.  If you want to make sure that
              symbols in given library are actually called, use -x @library_pattern instead.

       -L     When no -e option is given, don't assume the default action of @MAIN.

       -n, --indent nr
              Indent trace output by nr spaces for each level of call nesting. Using this option makes the program flow  visualization  easy  to
              follow. This indents uselessly also functions that never return, such as service functions for throwing exceptions in the C++
              runtime.

       -o, --output filename
              Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.

       -p pid Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing. This option can be used together with passing a command to
              execute. It is possible to attach to several processes by passing more than one option -p.

       -r     Print a relative timestamp with each line of the trace. This records the time difference between the beginning of successive
              lines.

       -s strsize
              Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32).

       -S     Display system calls as well as library calls

       -t     Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

       -tt    If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

       -ttt   If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and the leading portion will be printed as the number of seconds
              since the epoch.

       -T     Show  the  time  spent inside each call. This records the time difference between the beginning and the end of each call.

       -u username
              Run command with the userid, groupid and supplementary groups of username. This option is only useful when running as root and
              enables the correct execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number of ltrace and exit.

       -w, --where nr
              Show backtrace of nr stack frames for each traced function. This option enabled only if elfutils or libunwind support was enabled
              at compile time.

       -x filter
              A qualifying expression which modifies which symbol table entry points to trace. The format of the  filter  expression  is
              described  in  the  section  FILTER  EXPRESSIONS.  If more than one -x option appears on the command line, the symbols that match
              any of them are traced. No entry points are traced if no -x is given.

FILTER EXPRESSIONS
       Filter expression is a chain of glob- or regexp-based rules that are used to pick symbols for tracing from libraries  that  the  process
       uses. Most of it is intuitive, so as an example, the following would trace calls to malloc and free, except those done by libc:

       -e malloc+free-@libc.so*

       This reads: trace malloc and free, but don't trace anything that comes from something that matches libc.so*. Semi-formally, the syntax of
       the above example looks approximately like:

       {[+-][[symbol pattern][@library pattern]]}

       Symbol pattern is used to match symbol names, library pattern to match library SONAMEs. Both are implicitly globs, but can be  regular
       expressions  as well (see below). The glob syntax supports meta-characters * and ? and character classes, similarly to what basic bash
       globs support. ^ and $ are recognized to mean, respectively, start and end of string.

       Both symbol pattern and library pattern have to match the whole name. If you want  to  match  only  part  of  the  name,  surround  it
       with  *s as necessary. The exception is if the pattern is not mentioned at all, in which case it's as if the corresponding pattern were
       *. (So malloc is really malloc@* and @libc.* is really *@libc.*.)

       To use a regular expression, surround it in slashes:

       -x '/^(malloc|free)$/@libc.so.*'

       If the library pattern starts with a slash, it is not a SONAME expression, but a path expression, and is matched against the library path
       name.

       The first rule may lack a sign, in which case + is assumed. If, on the other hand, the first rule has a - sign, it is as if there was
       another rule @ in front of it, which has the effect of tracing complement of given rule.

       The  above  rules  are  used  to  construct  the  set  of traced symbols. Each candidate symbol is passed through the chain of above
       rules. Initially, the symbol is unmarked. If it matches a + rule, it becomes marked, if it matches a - rule, it becomes unmarked again.
       If, after applying all rules, the symbol is marked, it will be traced.

PROTOTYPE LIBRARY DISCOVERY
       When a library is mapped into the address space of a traced process, ltrace needs to know what the prototypes are of functions that  this
       library  implements.  For  purposes  of ltrace, prototype really is a bit more than just type signature: it's also formatting of
       individual parameters and of return value. These prototypes are stored in files called prototype libraries.

       After a library is mapped, ltrace finds out what its SONAME is. It then looks for a file named SONAME.conf--e.g. protolib for libc.so.6
       would be in a file called libc.so.6.conf. When such file is found (more on where ltrace looks for these files is below), ltrace reads all
       prototypes stored therein. When a symbol table entry point (such as those traced by -x) is hit, the prototype is looked up  in  a
       prototype  library  corresponding to the library where the hit occurred. When a library call (such as those traced by -e and -l) is hit,
       the prototype is looked up in all prototype libraries loaded for given process. That is necessary, because a library call is traced  in
       a PLT table of a caller library, but the prototype is described at callee library.

       If a library has no SONAME, basename of library file is considered instead. For the main program binary, basename is considered as well
       (e.g. protolib for /bin/echo would be called echo.conf). If a name corresponding to soname (e.g. libc.so.6.conf) is not found, and the
       SONAME  doesn't  contain  a  version  (e.g.  libc.so.6),  ltrace also tries partial matches of the SONAME against files available in
       prototype library directories. That way, libc.so.conf would be considered a match for library libc.so.6 as well as  libc.so.7.   The
       mechanism  is  similar  to  what  ldconfig(8)  does  when  searching  for  SONAMEs  in  library directories.

       By default, ltrace looks for prototype libraries in /usr/share/ltrace and /etc/ltrace-elf.conf.

BUGS
       It has most of the bugs stated in strace(1).

       It only works on Linux and in a small subset of architectures.

       Tracing  setuid  and  setgid  programs  is  not  supported.

       If you would like to report a bug, send a message to the mailing list (ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org), or use  the  reportbug(1)
       program if you are under the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
