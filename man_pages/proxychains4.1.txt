PROXYCHAINS4(1)                                               General Commands Manual                                              PROXYCHAINS4(1)

NAME
       proxychains4 - redirect connections through proxy servers

SYNOPSIS
       proxychains4 [-q] [-f config-file] program [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       ProxyChains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions in dynamically linked programs via a preloaded DLL and redirects
       the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.

       WARNING: this program can leak DNS requests when used with gethostbyname and will leak DNS requests when used with  tor.  You  should
       use tor-resolve(1) or the tor compatible socksify(1) program instead.

       This program works only on dynamically linked programs. Also both proxychains and the program to call must use the same dynamic linker
       (i.e. same libc).

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
              Don't print informational output from proxychains (version, config, etc).

       -f, --config-file config-file
              Use config-file instead of the default /etc/proxychains4.conf file.

FILES
       /etc/proxychains4.conf
              System-wide proxychains configuration file.

       ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf
              User configuration file (searched before system-wide configuration).

CONFIGURATION
       ProxyChains  searches  for  configuration  in  the  following  order:  file  listed  in  environment  variable  PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE,
       then  ./proxychains.conf,  then  ~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf, then /etc/proxychains4.conf, then /etc/proxychains.conf.

       The configuration file should contain:
       - General settings (quiet_mode, proxy_dns, remote_dns_subnet, tcp_read_time_out, tcp_connect_time_out)
       - Chain type (dynamic_chain, strict_chain, round_robin_chain, random_chain)
       - Proxy list

       Example configuration:
              dynamic_chain
              quiet_mode
              proxy_dns
              remote_dns_subnet 224
              tcp_read_time_out 15000
              tcp_connect_time_out 8000

              [ProxyList]
              # type  ip  port  [user pass]
              socks5  127.0.0.1 9050
              socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
              http    127.0.0.1 8118

CHAIN TYPES
       dynamic_chain
              Each connection will be done via chained proxies. All proxies in the list are used, dead proxies are skipped.

       strict_chain
              Each connection will be done via chained proxies. All proxies must be online or connection will fail.

       round_robin_chain
              Each connection will be done via chained proxies. Proxies are used in round-robin manner.

       random_chain
              Each connection will be done via random proxy from the list.

PROXY TYPES
       http   HTTP CONNECT proxy

       socks4 SOCKS4 proxy

       socks5 SOCKS5 proxy

ENVIRONMENT
       PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE
              Path to configuration file to use instead of default locations.

       PROXYCHAINS_QUIET_MODE
              Set to any value to enable quiet mode (equivalent to -q).

EXAMPLES
       Run telnet through proxies:
              proxychains4 telnet targethost.com

       Run ssh through proxies with custom config:
              proxychains4 -f ~/myproxy.conf ssh user@targethost.com

       Use with nmap:
              proxychains4 nmap -sT -Pn targethost.com

       Browse web with firefox:
              proxychains4 firefox

CAVEATS
       - Doesn't work with statically compiled programs
       - Doesn't work with setuid programs
       - DNS resolution is done through proxy only when proxy_dns is set
       - Some programs may not work due to the way they handle sockets
